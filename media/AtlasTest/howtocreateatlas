put all the images you want on your atlas in one folder. then call

java -jar $GAMEKIT/Tools/executables/java/gorillaConverter.jar [img-folder] [dest-folder] [gorilla-out-name]

make sure the result is found in regression/res.cfg, then you can use the atlas is gorilla


Usually you can also convert bitmap-fonts, but I can't get it to work


Internal docs (mayme they can help you more than me):

Create Fonts and place them in the Image-Folder (with the corresponding .xml/.fnt-file:
Option1)
 Tool: $GAMEKIT/Tools/executables/createFont.sh [outdir] [fontname]
 

Put all images and fonts in one folder:
Then call:
java -jar $GAMEKIT/Tools/executables/java/gorillaConverter.jar [img-folder] [dest-folder] [gorilla-out-name]




Option2)
 Tool: $GAMEKIT/Tools/executables/win32/bmfont/bmfont.exe
