These are some samples I made while using gamekit. Those are to show some aspects that are possible. Some a very buggy, but just to get a feeling for it

As gamekit-playground all of this is "take it, or leave it"-ware. Gamekit (Playground) is not developed any further....but still it is not that bad ;)

Just install the gamekit blender plugin, set the runtime to your gamekit playground runtime and load the test and run.

...or just go in the sample folder and run the tests like: $PATH_TO_YOUR_PLAYGROUND_RUNTIME/AppOgreKit [FILE.blend]
