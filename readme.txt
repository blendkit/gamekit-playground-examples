These are some samples I made while using gamekit. Those are to show some aspects that are possible. Some a very buggy, but just to get a feeling for it

As gamekit-playground all of this is "take it, or leave it"-ware. Gamekit (Playground) is not developed any further....but still it is not that bad ;)
